# AI Chatbot Component

This component adds an AI-powered chatbot to your personal website, allowing visitors to interact with an assistant that can answer questions about you and your work.

## Features

- Floating chat button in the bottom-right corner
- Expandable chat interface with message history
- Voice input support using the speech-to-text functionality
- End conversation with feedback option
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Setup Instructions

1. **Copy Files**
   - Ensure the `Chatbot.jsx` and `chatbot.css` files are in the `src/components/chatbot/` directory.

2. **Speech Recognition**
   - The SpeechRecorder component is included directly in the chatbot directory (`src/components/chatbot/speech-recorder.js`)
   - No external script loading is required - it's imported as a regular module

3. **Update App.js**
   - Import the Chatbot component in your App.js:
     ```js
     import Chatbot from "./components/chatbot/Chatbot";
     ```
   - Add the component at the end of your App component:
     ```jsx
     <Chatbot />
     ```

4. **Backend Connection**
   - The component uses the API configuration from `src/config/api.js`
   - Update the `API_URL` in this file to match your backend server address
   - The component expects the following API endpoints:
     - POST `/chat` - For sending messages
     - POST `/upload-audio` - For speech-to-text conversion
     - POST `/end-conversation` - For ending the conversation
   - To change deployment environment, just update the API_URL in the config file

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the chatbot by modifying the `chatbot.css` file:

- Change colors by updating the variables used (they inherit from your site's root variables)
- Adjust the size of the chat window by modifying the width and height properties
- Change the position by updating the right and bottom properties

## Usage

The chatbot provides a simple interface for users to:

1. Click the chat button to open the interface
2. Type questions or use voice input
3. End the conversation and provide feedback
4. Automatically sends conversation summary to your email (if configured in the backend)

## Mobile Responsiveness

The component is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes:
- Full-width layout on small screens
- Proper spacing and sizing on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly buttons
